      <div id="about-text">
        <p>The first step in designing this site was to create divs for a header, hero, main, and footer section. These were the basic sections
          that I knew all other content would fit in, and formed the template that would be copied to all other pages. After the appropriate amount
          of pages were created for the rest of the site, the divs were copied to them for consistency, and the card divs were made and modified to fit the specific content needs of each page.<br>
          An analogous color compliment was chosen to include three fall-like colors since hunting seasons are generally asosciated with that time of year. The header color is a primary, and the footer a tertiary. The third color is yellow shade utilized to mark the in-season days for each species on the calendar next to their respective pictures. For the large text in the hero section, like the company name on the home page for example, I used a fantasy style font named Copperplate. The smaller font in the name is a Brush Script that is in cursive. I chose to par these two together because there is a main part of the name which the Copperplate nicely emphasizes, and the cursive font is a nice font to blend and not demand attention. The rest of the text in the site is a sans-serif font named “Open Sans”.<br>
          I chose to include this site in an iframe to show that it does scale to some extent on smaller screens, but it would be better off it had the appropriately styled media queries to modify sttributes like flex-directions and sizes to take fuul advantage of the available real estate of smaller screened devices. It would also benefit greatly from incorporating javascript for form validation that would not only ensure the email was formatted properly, but also that teh password met all criteria and was confirmed.
